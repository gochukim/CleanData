    "contents" : "This script \"CodeBook.md\"\" describes the variables, the data, and any \ntransformations or work that was performed to clean up the data\n=========\n\n# Source Files / Data\n=========\nSource data - https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip\n\nThe source files we use to create the tidy data set from the extracted data archive are:\nfeatures_info.txt - Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector\nfeatures.txt - Measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement\nactivity_labels.txt - Links the class labels with their activity name\ntrain/X_train.txt - Training set\ntrain/y_train.txt - Training labels\ntrain/subject_train.txt - Identifies the train subject who performed the activity for each window sample\ntest/X_test.txt - Testing set\ntest/y_test.txt - Testing labels\ntest/subject_test.txt - Identifies the test subject who performed the activity for each window sample\nmerged_clean_data.txt - Data that's been cleansed and merged\ndata_set_with_averages.txt - The final tidy data set with averages\n\n# Variables\n=========\ntrain_temp - Temporary training data set\ntest_temp - Temporart testing data set\nmerge_x - Merges the training data set and the testing data set\nmerge_s - Merges the training and testing subject data\nmerge_y - Merges the training label and the testing label data\nfeatures - Reads the table \"features.txt\"\"\nextract_data - Extraction of standard deviation\nActivities - Reads the table \"activity_labels.txt\"\ncleaned - Clean data set with descriptive activity name labels\nunique_subject - identifies the unique subject data\nlength_subject - identifies the length of subjects\nlength_activities - identifies the length of activities\nnumber_column - identifies the number of columns\nnew_data - new tidy data set with each activity and each subject\nnew_average - new tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject\n\n\n# Transformations\n=========\n1. Merges the training and test sets to create one data set using:\ntrain/X_train.txt with test/X_test.txt - the result is a 10299 x 561 data frame, \nas in the original description (\"Number of Instances: 10299\" and \"Number of Attributes: 561\")\n\ntrain/subject_train.txt with test/subject_test.txt - the result is a 10299 x 1 data frame with subject IDs,\n\ntrain/y_train.txt with test/y_test.txt - the result is also a 10299 x 1 data frame with activity IDs.\n\n2. Reads file features.txt and extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.\nThe result is a 10299 x 66 data frame, because only 66 out of 561 attributes are measurements on the mean and standard deviation. \nAll measurements appear to be floating point numbers in the range (-1, 1).\n\n3. Reads activity_labels.txt and applies descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set:\nwalking\nwalkingupstairs\nwalkingdownstairs\nsitting\nstanding\nlaying\n\n4. The script also appropriately labels the data set with descriptive names: \nall feature names (attributes) and activity names are converted to lower case, underscores and brackets () are removed.\nThen it merges the 10299x66 data frame containing features with 10299x1 data frames containing activity labels and subject IDs.\n\nThe result is saved as merged_clean_data.txt, a 10299x68 data frame such that the first column contains subject IDs, the second column activity names, and the last 66 columns are measurements. Subject IDs are integers between 1 and 30 inclusive. Names of the attributes are similar to the following:\n\ntbodyacc-mean-x\ntbodyacc-mean-y\ntbodyacc-mean-z\ntbodyacc-std-x\ntbodyacc-std-y\ntbodyacc-std-z\ntgravityacc-mean-x\ntgravityacc-mean-y\n\n5. Finally, the script creates a 2nd, independent tidy data set with the average of each measurement for each activity and each subject.\nThe result is saved as data_set_with_averages.txt, a 180x68 data frame, where as before, the first column contains subject IDs, the second column contains activity names (see below), and then the averages for each of the 66 attributes are in columns 3...68. There are 30 subjects and 6 activities, thus 180 rows in this data set with averages.",
