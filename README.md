CleanData

Getting and Cleaning Data Project - Johns Hopkins University, Coursera Class

=========

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with,
and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for 
later analysis. You will find these three files in the repository: 

1) a tidy data set as described below,

2) a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, 

3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations 
or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md

4) this README.md file in the repo to explain how all of the scripts work and 
how they are connected.

==========

Here are the data used for the project:

==========

The R script called "run_analysis.R"" will perform the following:

1) Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2) Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each 
measurement. 

3) Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4) Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

5) Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable
for each activity and each subject. 

==========

The script "CodeBook.md"" describes the variables, the data, and any 
transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data
